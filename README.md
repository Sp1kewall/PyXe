# PyXe 2.9 
After a long hiatus, I have completed the update for `PyXe 2.9`.  

## What's new:
1. Creating custom commands (modules)
2. The mechanism for processing commands and arguments has been rewritten
3. Carbonate's built-in file editor has been updated

## Essential Libraries for Python:
- Colorama - `pip install colorama`
- Wget - `pip install wget`
- prompt_toolkit - `pip install prompt-toolkit`
- lib_platform - `pip install lib-platform`

That's all for now. I'll be adding more improvements to the program in the near future.
