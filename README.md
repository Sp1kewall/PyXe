# PyXe command shell

## Just my terminal

Innovations:

To reduce the size of the source code file, all language settings and the languages ​​themselves were removed. Only English remains

Now when you start the shell, version information is displayed on the screen

I'm ditching binaries entirely and going back to source since I can't produce executables for all platforms (especially Linux)

Version as of 26/11/2023 - 2.8
