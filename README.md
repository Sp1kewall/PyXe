PyXe Its a opensource command shell written in Python *(I know thats C++ would be better)*.


### PyXe differs from other command shells:



### Convenience.

The commands are easy to understand and I try to minimize the presence of "pitfalls" in this understanding. If something is not clear to you, just enter `help` or `help --{command}`.

### Customization.

I periodically add and remove something, but no one forbids you to change the PyXe code on your computer as you like.

### Modernization.

PyXe supports modules that you can write yourself and integrate them into the program right on the go.



*However, PyXe can be a bit slow sometimes, especially on weak PCs (I mean potato PCs)*
